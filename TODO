Currently, draft1 is deployed from master and running. Much more work is
needed before this is ready for primetime.

Many tests should be written.


TODO:
    - We should log to a file someday like an adult process.

    - We should manage a timeframe to block these attempts and then expire the
        blocks that we create. Instead of a "block forever" method that we have
        now. This would allow us to clean up the memory footprint.

    - We should have some way to ask the currently running process about some
        some current stats. Like, how many ips have been blocked today? How many
        have you blocked in the last 4 hours?

    - More features should be described in greater detail someday. :|

FIXED:
    The BREAKING current issue that I discovered was the issue was that the log
        file was gone, and the process seemed to have given up. I need to write some
        tests for this and even do some manual testing. That didn't happen.
    Here is the last line in the screen session as the process died:
        2015/11/22 06:37:10 Stopping tail as file no longer exists: /var/log/auth.log
